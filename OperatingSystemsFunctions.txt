Backup Functions:
Many modern operating systems have a built-in backup function.  Some backup functions just copy the exact contents of a storage device.  I just need to create a simple disc image to restore in case Acer support feels the need to format my hard drive, but more advanced backup tools let you restore individual files, and even keep track of multiple versions of individual files.  Systems like Apple's Time Machine make incremental backups, meaning that identical files in two backups aren't duplicated in the two backups.  But you can scroll through what appear to be many full backups to a backup from a particular date, and then browse the full contents of the backed up disc from that time.
